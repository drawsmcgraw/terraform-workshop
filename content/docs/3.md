# Adding a Network

```
resource "aws_subnet" "public-subnet" {
    vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.main.id

    cidr_block = "10.0.X.0/24"
    availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
    map_public_ip_on_launch = true

    tags = {
        Name = "Nick Public Subnet"
    }
}

```

Please note that after each block of code I'm expecting you to run ``terraform apply``. I'm leaving it out due to brevity.

Now this won't be routable to the web. It's just a floating subnet that can never be used. Let's create a Route Table and a Route Table Association.

```
resource "aws_route_table" "public-subnet" {
    vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.main.id

    route {
        cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
        gateway_id = "igw-0933899a953c4b311"
    }

    tags = {
        Name = "Nick Public Subnet"
    }
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public-subnet" {
    subnet_id = aws_subnet.public-subnet.id
    route_table_id = aws_route_table.public-subnet.id
}
```
