# Variables

Up to this point we've been hard-coding *A LOT* of entries. Let's clean up after ourselves. 

First let's create a **variables.tf** file. This is for our variable definitions.
```
variable "region" {}
variable "vpc-id" {}
```

Now back to **main.tf** at the top replace this section
```
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = "us-east-1"
}
```

With this section:
```
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = var.region
}
```

Once you're done with that go ahead and do a ``terraform apply`` again. You should see this result:

```
var.region
  Enter a value:
```

It's now prompting you for input. Go ahead and enter in your region. 

This isn't optimal if you want to automate this as part of a CI/CD process. Let's store the variable in a special file called **terraform.tfvars**
```
region = "us-east-1"
```

Now let's replace this section:
```
data "aws_vpc" "main" {
  id = "vpc-0b3dd6b2d0c53ccb2"
}
```

With this:
```
data "aws_vpc" "main" {
  id = var.vpc-id
}
```

{{< hint danger >}}
Don't forget to add your vpc-id to the **terraform.tfvars** file!
{{< /hint >}}

Now let's do the same for the entries in the "aws_subnet" resource. 
```
resource "aws_subnet" "public-subnet" {
    vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.main.id

    cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
    availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
    map_public_ip_on_launch = true

    tags = {
        Name = "Nick Public Subnet"
    }
}
```
{{< hint info >}}
Go ahead and do this for the **cidr_block**, **availability_zone** and the **tags** entires. This will be left as an exercise to the user.
