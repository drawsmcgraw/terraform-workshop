# Getting Started

After you have the CLI's installed let's make a working directory to work in. I'm just going to call mine ``terraform``. Once you have that created move into that directory. 

Create a file named *main.tf*
```
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

data "aws_vpc" "main" {
  id = "YOUR_VPC_ID"
}

output "vpc" {
    value = data.aws_vpc.main
}
```

Then run:
```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The output should be something like this:
```
data.aws_vpc.main: Refreshing state...

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

vpc = {
  "arn" = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:699649708535:vpc/vpc-0b3dd6b2d0c53ccb2"
  "cidr_block" = "10.0.0.0/16"
  "cidr_block_associations" = [
    {
      "association_id" = "vpc-cidr-assoc-06f7990fb7bab3dd7"
      "cidr_block" = "10.0.0.0/16"
      "state" = "associated"
    },
  ]
  "default" = false
  "dhcp_options_id" = "dopt-09d4d3e7043235eca"
  "enable_dns_hostnames" = true
  "enable_dns_support" = true
  "id" = "vpc-0b3dd6b2d0c53ccb2"
  "instance_tenancy" = "default"
  "main_route_table_id" = "rtb-08864f01df438ed43"
  "owner_id" = "699649708535"
  "state" = "available"
  "tags" = {
    "Name" = "terraform"
  }
}
```
